Day 14 of advent of code for 2015 part 1.
This is my advent of code proof.

### How to use the args?
- First argument args[0] required for adding the max amount of time in seconds as integers
2053 F:\development\adventofcode\src\adventofcode2015\day14\testInput.txt

- second argument args[1] required for setting a path, if this is not set
default value "F:\development\adventofcode\src\adventofcode2015\day14\input.txt";
will be used.

To run compile and add arg[0] how many seconds the reindeers should run.,
use args[1] to set the file directory, as default you may not have that path setup.
